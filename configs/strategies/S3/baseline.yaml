  S3 baseline configuration for extreme reversion.
  Context feature: atr_14 (volatility regime check)
  Value feature: bb_pb_20 (Bollinger %b, oversold indicator)
  Value threshold: 0.1 (near lower band, expecting reversion)
  Filter mode: NONE (no additional filtering)
  Trigger mode: NONE (market next open entry)
  Note: For extreme reversion, value_feature < value_threshold triggers (oversold condition).
